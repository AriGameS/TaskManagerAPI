## üéØ KEY QUESTIONS TO ANSWER

### WHERE?

1. **Where are tests running?**
   - GitHub Actions runners (ubuntu-latest)
   - Cloud-based CI/CD infrastructure

2. **Where is Docker image built?**
   - Locally: Developer machines
   - CI/CD: GitHub Actions runners
   - Production: Can be built on any server

3. **Where does the application run?**
   - Development: Local Docker containers
   - Production: Can deploy to any cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Current: Docker container on port 5125

4. **Where is code stored?**
   - Local: Git repository
   - Remote: GitHub (https://github.com/AriGameS/TaskManagerAPI)

### WHEN?

1. **When do tests run?**
   - On every push to main/develop branches
   - On every pull request
   - Before deployment

2. **When is Docker image built?**
   - During CI/CD pipeline (after tests pass)
   - Manually by developers
   - Before deployment

3. **When does deployment happen?**
   - After successful CI pipeline completion
